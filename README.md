## Course Introduction

- COVID-19 has been around for a while.
- During this time, various methodologies have been developed to tackle various problems related to COVID-19.
- This course aims to teach to various Data Science & Machine Learning concepts by solving various problems related to COVID-19.
- It's a project-based learning, which will help you understand how you can apply data science on real life datasets and not any dummy dataset.
- We will go through lot of concepts, frameworks, tools.

## Learning Objectives

- Work on complete end-to-end real-time projects related to COVID-19.
- Apply Deep Learning and Machine Learning concepts on real world use cases.
- Apply concepts like Time series Analysis, Dashboard Building, LSTMs, Object Detection, GBMs, Chatbot building.
- Work with various types of data which includes structured and unstructured data like text, image, videos.

## Course Structure

- Project based - each section is indepependent of each other
- Each project is divided into:
    - problem statement
    - approach
    - solution
        - covers different concept, framework, tools
